## Project Overview

A production-ready **Marketing Journey Builder** that simulates Insider One's core automation platform. Users create cross-channel marketing flows (Trigger → Condition → Action) across channels like WhatsApp, SMS, and Email. The system is designed to reflect the scale and architectural maturity expected of a platform handling **2.2 billion daily requests**.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Feature-Driven Structure

Every feature is a self-contained module under `src/features/`. A feature owns its components, store, types, composables, and tests. Nothing leaks outside its boundary without becoming a shared `src/components/` or `src/composables/` utility.

### 2. Strict TypeScript — Zero `any`

- All props, emits, store state, API responses, and composable return types must be fully typed.
- Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/aliases.
- Never use `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` without a written comment explaining why.

### 3. Composition API Only

- Always use `<script setup>` syntax.
- Never use Options API.
- Extract reusable logic into composables under `src/composables/` or feature-level `composables/`.

### 4. Component Naming

- Base UI components: `Ins` prefix → `InsButton.vue`, `InsInput.vue`
- Feature components: descriptive → `JourneyCanvas.vue`, `NodeSidebar.vue`
- Views (pages): `View` suffix → `DashboardView.vue`, `JourneyBuilderView.vue`

### 5. Pinia Store Rules

- One store per feature domain.
- Store files named: `useJourneyStore.ts`, `useAuthStore.ts`
- State must be typed with an `interface`, never inferred from an object literal.
- No direct state mutation outside actions.

### 6. API / Data Layer

- All API calls go through `src/core/api/` clients.
- In development, MSW intercepts requests — no real backend needed.
- Never call `fetch()` or `axios` directly from a component or store. Always use a repository function.

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env and fill in values
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=         # From sentry.io project settings
VITE_APP_ENV=development # development | staging | production
VITE_API_BASE_URL=       # Mock or real API base
```

---

## Testing Standards

- **Every component** in `src/components/base/` must have a Vitest test.
- **Every Pinia store** must have action and getter tests.
- **Every critical user flow** must have a Playwright E2E spec.
- Minimum coverage target: **80%** (enforced in CI).
- Tests live next to the code they test: `InsButton.vue` → `InsButton.test.ts`

## AI Collaboration Notes

See `docs/ai-collaboration.md` for a detailed log of how AI tools were used throughout this project — including prompt strategies, architectural decisions made with AI assistance, and where human judgment overrode AI suggestions.

## Code Style

- No code comments. Code must be self-documenting through clear naming.
- Exception: genuinely non-obvious business logic only.

## Commit Strategy

- Commit after every small completed unit of work — a bug fix, a new
  feature, a test, a config change, a refactor. Do not batch unrelated
  changes into a single commit.
- Always follow Conventional Commits format:
  - `feat:` new feature or component
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `test:` adding or updating tests
  - `docs:` documentation changes
  - `chore:` config, dependencies, tooling
  - `refactor:` code restructure without behavior change
- Before committing, always run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`
- Commit messages are validated by Husky — do not bypass hooks
- NEVER run `git push` automatically. Always stage and commit the work,
  then stop and ask the user for approval before pushing.
